# Wobble-animation

Hi, thank you for reading my Wobble UI animator
If you are an animator and you want to add a fast wobble animation, for example, when a chopper is flying, or a coin is flipping, this is your tool.

# How it works
  Open the UI
  Select your geometry you want to animate
  Adjust the settings and click wobble! Done!

# How to install:
  Download the files and set them in your Maya -> scripts folder
  Type this in your script editor in Maya (the icon in the bottom left):

    import wobble_gui_lanh_v02 as wui
    import importlib
    importlib.reload(wui)
    wui.main()

  Drag this into your toolbar to set it as a button, and done.
